# CD-Hit file Parser
# what is CD-HIT?
CD-HIT clusters proteins into clusters that meet a user-defined similarity threshold, usually a
sequence identity. Each cluster has one representative sequence. The input is a protein dataset in
fasta format and the output are two files: a fasta file of representative sequences and a text file of list
of clusters.
